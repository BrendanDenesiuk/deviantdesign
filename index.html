        <b>Aesthetic, the Deviant, & The proper </b> is a digital publication
        that works to investigate & summarize various typographic & design
        conventions, to find the separation between colonial ideas &
        “logical” ones, in addition to providing a discussion about Art vs
        Design, & a short critique of the nature of “Anti-Design”. <b>Aesthetic, the Deviant, & The proper </b>
        is an example of a visual essay, &,
        as such, makes usage of visuals to support its textual arguments.

        Through its visual presentation, this piece makes an effective
        point about visually assisted writing, as most of the points raised
        within this text could not be made without the included visuals.
        Indeed, with <b>enough</b> writing, these points could be conveyed in
        a purely textual format, though certainly not nearly as efficiently or
        elegantly as in its current state.

        The text itself was created in response to Craig Martin’s text <b>Deviant
        Design</b>, highlighting the idea that there is no clear divide between
        deviance & the proper, & Marshall McLuhan’s <b>The Meaning is the
        Massage</b>, demonstrating that the presentation of a given piece can
        hold as much information as the written content. This is reflected
        through the pieces’ commentary on design conventions, & through
        its use of dynamic & often unorthodox layouts for each given
        spread. Each spread within this text was designed with a different
        visual focus—one can think of each spread (or, sometimes, set of
      </div>

      <div class='text' style='rotate: 3deg; margin-top: 5rem'>
        spreads) as paragraphs within the visual essay, each with their own
        separate points to address. In some regards, the visual elements of
        each spread (or collection of spreads) almost act as the “thesis” for
        said section. While the writing of <b>Aesthetic, the Deviant, & The
        proper</b> is intended to lead from one page to the next, it was written in
        a way where each spread/set of spreads could exist in isolation & still
        properly illustrate its point—allowing a reader to skip parts they don’t
        find relevant to their own thoughts about design, without necessarily
        missing out on the piece as a whole.
